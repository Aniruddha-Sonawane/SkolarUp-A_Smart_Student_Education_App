# SkolarUp-A_Smart_Student_Education_App

<h1>SkolarUp – Student Learning App</h1>

<b>S<b>kolarUp is a simple education-focused mobile application built using React Native and Expo.
The goal of the project is to provide students with a central place to access books, notes, posts, reports, and study-related content.
    This project helped me practice building a structured mobile app, working with multiple screens, and
organizing a real-world codebase.
