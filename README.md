# SkolarUp – Student Learning App

SkolarUp is a simple and student-focused mobile application built using React Native and Expo.
The aim of the project is to bring books, notes, posts, reports, and study-related tools together in one place, with a clean and minimal interface.

This project helped me understand real-world app structure, routing, component reuse, and managing multiple screens in a React Native environment.
